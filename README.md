## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API communication

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for database
- JWT for authentication
- Multer for file uploads

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Client Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client should be available at http://localhost:5173

### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update MongoDB URI and JWT secret as needed.

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server runs on http://localhost:5000 by default.

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
- Client: `npm run dev` in the client directory
- Server: `npm run dev` in the server directory (uses nodemon for auto-reload)

### Default Login Credentials
For development purposes, you can use these credentials:
- Username: `dev`
- Password: `dev123`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **MongoDB connection error**: Ensure MongoDB is running and the connection string is correct
2. **API calls failing**: Check that the client and server are both running and CORS is configured correctly
3. **Image uploads not working**: Verify that the uploads directory exists and has write permissions
4. **Authentication issues**: Ensure your JWT_SECRET is set and not exposed publicly
